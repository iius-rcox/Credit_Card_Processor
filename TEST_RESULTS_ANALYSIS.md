## Root Causes

### 1. IPv6 vs IPv4 Connection Issue
The API tests are trying to connect to `::1:8000` (IPv6 localhost) but the backend is listening on `0.0.0.0:8000` (IPv4). This causes connection refused errors.

### 2. No Test Data
Session-related tests fail because there are no sessions in the database. Tests expect at least one session to exist for testing modals and interactions.

### 3. Frontend Port Mismatch
Frontend is running on port 3001 (because 3000 was in use) but tests are configured for port 3000.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes
1. **API Connection**: Configure backend to listen on both IPv4 and IPv6, or update tests to use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`
2. **Test Data**: Create seed data or mock sessions for testing
3. **Port Configuration**: Either free up port 3000 or update test configuration to use port 3001

### Test Improvements
1. Add test data setup/teardown
2. Mock API responses for isolation
3. Add retry logic for flaky tests
4. Separate unit tests from integration tests

## Correlation ID Implementation Status
✅ Successfully implemented and integrated:
- Frontend generates unique correlation IDs for each request
- Backend accepts and propagates correlation IDs
- Logging includes correlation IDs for request tracking
- Headers properly configured for bi-directional correlation

## Overall Assessment
The application core functionality is working, with the main issues being test environment configuration and lack of test data. The correlation ID implementation is complete and functioning correctly, providing excellent debugging capabilities.
