- `.status-badge` - Status indicator styling

## State Management

The component integrates with the Pinia session store:

```javascript

sessionStore.setResults(data)
sessionStore.updateEmployeeResolution(revisionId, resolutionData)
sessionStore.updateBulkEmployeeResolution(revisionIds, resolutionData)
```
