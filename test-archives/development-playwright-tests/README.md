## 🎯 **Purpose of These Tests**

These tests were instrumental in:

1. **🔧 Debugging Issues**: 
   - Authentication problems
   - File upload failures
   - Processing errors
   - Progress tracking issues

2. **✅ Validating Fixes**:
   - PDF validation corrections
   - Session store integration
   - Progress polling startup
   - Timezone datetime issues

3. **📊 End-to-End Verification**:
   - Complete user workflows
   - Real file processing
   - UI progress indicators
   - Error handling

## 📈 **Development Timeline**

These tests chronicle the development journey:

1. **Initial Setup**: Basic auth and session tests
2. **Upload Issues**: File upload debugging and validation
3. **Processing Problems**: Mock vs real processing configuration
4. **Progress Tracking**: Status polling and UI updates
5. **Production Ready**: Final workflow verification

---

## 🚀 **Current Status**

**✅ Development Complete**: All major issues resolved
**✅ Production Ready**: Application now uses real OCR processing
**✅ Tests Archived**: Files moved here for historical reference

## 🛠️ **Using These Tests**

### **If You Need to Debug Issues:**
```bash
# Copy a test file back to root directory
cp test-archives/development-playwright-tests/test-complete-workflow-fixed.js .

# Install Playwright (if not already installed)
npm install -D @playwright/test

# Run the test
node test-complete-workflow-fixed.js
```

### **Important Notes:**
- These tests expect the development environment to be running
- Some tests may need updates for current codebase
- Screenshots show historical UI states
- Configuration may need adjustments

## 📝 **Key Lessons Learned**

1. **Authentication**: Environment variables needed browser-compatible format
2. **File Validation**: PDF validation was too strict initially
3. **Progress Polling**: Required proper session store integration
4. **Timezone Issues**: DateTime handling needed careful timezone management
5. **Mock vs Real**: Production should never use mock processing
