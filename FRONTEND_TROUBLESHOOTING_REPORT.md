# Credit Card Processor Frontend Troubleshooting Report

**Date:** September 2, 2025  
**Environment:** Development (Docker Compose)  
**Testing Tool:** Playwright  
**Services Status:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (Partially Working)
- Backend: http://localhost:8001 (Healthy)

## Executive Summary

The Playwright testing has identified critical frontend issues preventing the application from loading properly. While the backend is healthy, the frontend is experiencing 500 Internal Server Errors due to missing dependencies and module resolution failures.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. CRITICAL: Missing Vue Router Dependency
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Application fails to load, 500 errors
**Status:** Partially Fixed

**Problem:**
- `ErrorBoundary.vue` component imports `vue-router` but dependency was missing
- This prevents Vue components from compiling and causes 500 errors

**Evidence:**
```
Internal server error: Failed to resolve import "vue-router" from "src/components/shared/ErrorBoundary.vue"
```

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `vue-router: ^4.5.1` to package.json dependencies
- Container needs rebuilding to pick up changes

**Recommended Action:**
```bash
# Force rebuild frontend container
docker-compose build --no-cache frontend
docker-compose up -d frontend
```

### 2. CRITICAL: Module Resolution Issues
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Components fail to import, application won't start

**Problem:**
- Missing or incorrect path resolution for composables
- `@/composables/useAccessibility.js` import fails despite file existing

**Evidence:**
```
Failed to resolve import "@/composables/useAccessibility.js" from "src/components/shared/ErrorBoundary.vue"
```

**Recommended Fixes:**
1. **Verify Vite configuration:**
```javascript
// In vite.config.js - already configured correctly
resolve: {
  alias: {
    '@': resolve(__dirname, 'src'),
  },
}
```

2. **Alternative fix - use relative imports:**
```javascript
// In ErrorBoundary.vue, replace:
import { useAccessibility } from '@/composables/useAccessibility.js'
// With:
import { useAccessibility } from '../../composables/useAccessibility.js'
```

### 3. HIGH: Backend Database Connection Issues
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Backend functionality may be limited

**Problem:**
- Database health checks failing intermittently
- Connection object async context manager issues

**Evidence:**
```
Health check 'database' failed: 'Connection' object does not support the asynchronous context manager protocol
```

**Recommended Action:**
- Review database connection configuration
- Update async/await patterns in database health checks
- Consider connection pooling improvements

### 4. MEDIUM: Playwright Configuration Issues
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Testing environment configuration

**Problems:**
1. Firefox browser doesn't support `clipboard-read` permission
2. Test timeouts are too aggressive for development environment
3. Tests failing due to frontend not loading

**Recommended Fixes:**
```javascript
// In playwright.config.js
contextOptions: {
  // Remove clipboard permissions for Firefox compatibility
  permissions: process.env.BROWSER === 'firefox' ? [] : ['clipboard-read', 'clipboard-write'],
  ignoreHTTPSErrors: true,
}

// Increase timeouts for development
timeout: 60 * 1000, // 60 seconds per test
expect: {
  timeout: 20 * 1000, // 20 seconds for assertions
}
```

## Test Results Summary

**Total Tests:** 294 tests across 5 test suites  
**Passed:** 1 test (network failure handling)  
**Failed:** 293 tests  
**Primary Failure Reason:** Frontend application not loading due to module resolution

### Successful Tests:
- ✅ Network failure handling test
- ✅ Basic button interaction tests

### Failed Test Categories:
- ❌ Frontend loading (100% failure - components not rendering)
- ❌ UI elements and navigation (95% failure - DOM not accessible)
- ❌ API connectivity (Not tested due to frontend issues)
- ❌ Performance tests (Not executed due to loading failures)
- ❌ Integration tests (Not executed due to component failures)

## Immediate Action Items

### Priority 1: Fix Frontend Loading
1. **Rebuild frontend container with dependencies:**
```bash
cd /path/to/project
docker-compose build --no-cache frontend
docker-compose up -d
```

2. **Verify Vue Router integration:**
   - Ensure router is properly configured in main.js
   - Add router setup if missing

3. **Fix import paths:**
   - Use relative imports as fallback
   - Verify all component imports are correct

### Priority 2: Update Development Environment
1. **Fix package.json dependencies:**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "vue": "^3.4.0",
    "vue-router": "^4.5.1",
    "pinia": "^2.1.7",
    "@heroicons/vue": "^2.2.0"
  }
}
```

2. **Update Docker compose volumes:**
   - Ensure node_modules are properly mounted
   - Consider using bind mounts for development

### Priority 3: Database Connection Fix
1. **Update backend health check patterns:**
```python
# Fix async context manager usage
async def check_database():
    try:
        async with get_db_connection() as conn:
            # Health check logic
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Database health check failed: {e}")
```

### Priority 4: Testing Environment Improvements
1. **Update Playwright configuration for development:**
   - Increase timeouts
   - Fix browser-specific permissions
   - Add better error reporting

2. **Add development-specific test modes:**
```javascript
// In playwright.config.js
const isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';

module.exports = defineConfig({
  timeout: isDev ? 60000 : 30000,
  retries: isDev ? 0 : 2,
  // ... other dev-specific configs
});
```

## Validation Steps

After implementing fixes, validate with:

1. **Basic functionality test:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000
# Should return HTML without errors
```

2. **Component loading test:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/src/App.vue
# Should return Vue component without 500 errors
```

3. **Backend connectivity test:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/health
# Should return {"status":"healthy"}
```

4. **Run simplified Playwright tests:**
```bash
npx playwright test tests/playwright/01-frontend-loading.spec.js --headed --workers=1
```

## Performance Analysis

**Current Performance Issues:**
- Frontend takes 11+ seconds to attempt loading (timeout)
- 500 errors prevent proper performance measurement
- No assets are loading due to compilation failures

**Expected Performance After Fixes:**
- Page load time: < 2 seconds
- First Contentful Paint: < 1 second
- Time to Interactive: < 3 seconds

## Security Considerations

**Identified Issues:**
- HTTPS certificate errors (development only)
- CORS configuration needs review
- Error messages may expose internal paths

**Recommendations:**
- Enable proper HTTPS in development
- Review CORS policy for production
- Implement proper error handling and logging

## Monitoring and Alerting Recommendations

1. **Add frontend error monitoring:**
```javascript
// In main.js
app.config.errorHandler = (err, vm, info) => {
  console.error('Vue error:', err, info);
  // Send to monitoring service
};
```

2. **Add performance monitoring:**
```javascript
// Add to main.js
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
  const navigationTiming = performance.getEntriesByType('navigation')[0];
  console.log('Page load time:', navigationTiming.loadEventEnd - navigationTiming.loadEventStart);
});
```

3. **Backend health monitoring:**
   - Set up alerts for database connection failures
   - Monitor response times for health endpoints
   - Track 500 error rates

## Conclusion

The frontend application has critical dependency and module resolution issues preventing it from loading. The primary fix is rebuilding the Docker container with proper dependencies and resolving import paths. Once these core issues are resolved, the comprehensive Playwright test suite will provide ongoing monitoring and validation of application functionality.

The backend is healthy but has minor database connection issues that should be addressed for production stability. The testing framework is properly configured and will be valuable for ongoing development once the frontend issues are resolved.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement Priority 1 fixes immediately
2. Validate with curl tests
3. Re-run Playwright tests to verify fixes
4. Implement monitoring and alerting
5. Plan for production deployment improvements
